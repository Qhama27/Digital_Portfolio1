Welcome to my digital portfolio. My name is **Qhama Dyushu**, a 3rd-year student pursuing a **Diploma in Information and Communication Technology**.  
This portfolio has been developed as part of the **Work Readiness Training Programme** for *Project Presentation 3 (PRP370-1-2S)*.  
It showcases my development through structured reflections and practical artefacts based on five key areas: **Business Communication, Interview Skills, Mock Interview, Professional Networking, and Workplace Etiquette.**  
Each section applies the **STAR Technique** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to highlight how I have built the confidence, professionalism, and skills to thrive in the workplace.
